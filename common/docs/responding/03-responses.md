# Responses (HTTP)

Responses are not a separate component, but are part of larger components which provide specific
input / output components for your application.  The most common response is an HTTP response.
This is what is documented here.  If you're writing a command line application, check out
[the inKWell CLI component](../supplemental/01-cli).

## Installation

```bash
composer require dotink/inkwell-http
```

<div class="notice">
	<p>
		You do not need to explicitly install this package if you're using the inKWell routing
		package.
	</p>
</div>
