# Installation of inKWell

As with any modern framework, you can use [composer](https://getcomposer.org) to get yourself
started quickly and easily.

```bash
composer create-project -s dev inkwell/framework <target>
```

## Why Development Stability?

The inKWell framework is currently in a prolonged beta.  Although it's unlikely that developer
facing functionality will break, there's still some work being done on how certain components
interact.  We encourage users to submit [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/dotink/inkwell-framework/issues)
for any of the documented functionality if we break it.
