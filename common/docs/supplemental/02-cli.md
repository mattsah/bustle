# CLI

The CLI component is designed to allow inKWell to handle CLI requests/responses via a separate
gateway server/client implementation.  Much like HTTP requests/responses, these can be handled
by a router which is sufficiently agnostic.  This allows you to implement CLI commands the same
way you would implement handling for HTTP requests.

## Installation

This component is not yet available.
